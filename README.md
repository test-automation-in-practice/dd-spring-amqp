# Spring AMQP demonstration

## Introduction

This project was build on learning about the usage of [RabbitMQ](/documentation/glossary/rabbitmq.md) in a [Spring Boot](/documentation/glossary/springboot.md) environment and it can be also used as demonstration of [Spring AMQP](/documentation/glossary/spring-amqp.md).

## Quick start

Quick start can be followed [here](/documentation/quick-start.md).

## Structure

Several use cases were implemented in this project, out of many possibilites. In a seprate section those possibilities and the concrete implementation are further [described](/documentation/structure.md).

## Glossary

* [Messaging Protocols](/documentation/glossary/messaging-protocols.md)
* [RabbitMQ](/documentation/glossary/rabbitmq.md)
* [Spring Boot](/documentation/glossary/springboot.md)
* [Spring AMQP](/documentation/glossary/spring-amqp.md)
