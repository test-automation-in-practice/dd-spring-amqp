# Spring AMQP

Source: https://spring.io/projects/spring-amqp

The Spring AMQP project applies core Spring concepts to the development of AMQP-based messaging solutions. It provides a "template" as a high-level abstraction for sending and receiving messages. It also provides support for Message-driven POJOs with a "listener container". These libraries facilitate management of AMQP resources while promoting the use of dependency injection and declarative configuration. In all of these cases, you will see similarities to the JMS support in the Spring Framework.
